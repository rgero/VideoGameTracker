# Workflows
These are things that I'd expect the user to be able to do from the website.
## What would be needed for a MVP

 1. Sign up for an Account
 2. Log into the Account
 3. Search for games based on any of the data model criteria
 4. Add that game to one of their three lists
	 * Important validation - They shouldn't be able to add the game to multiple lists.
 5. Be able to move the game between their lists.
 6. Remove the game from their lists
 7. Change their account details
	 * Login credentials
	 * Profile Picture
	 * Display Name

## What would be nice to expand
1. Maintaining a friend/follow list
2. Leave a rating on games
