# Data Model
This document is going to be a brainstorming session for what would be needed in order to make this project work. The goal, as stated in the README.md is to make this a website similar to the way that Goodreads works, but for Video Games. 

## Games
The first thing I think we'd need is a game object. What's the data that I'd need to capture for each one for a MVP?

- Title of the Game
- Publisher
- Systems available for it to be played on
- Release Date
- Cover Art?

### Nice to haves
- How long to beat
- Ratings (pulled externally?
- Places to buy? If I can create an affiliate link with Amazon that'd be dope.
- An internal rating system with comments/Reviews left by users

## Accounts
This is going to be the account of the person. Again following Goodreads as the example what would I need?

- Display Name
- Lists
	- Want to Play
	- Currently Playing
	- Have Played
- Profile Picture
- Login Credentials

### Nice to Haves
- Friends
- Custom Lists
	- Goodreads has the ability to create your own "bookshelves" but these are just really some sort of tagging system.
- Gaming Challenges
